The library contains of set of assembler hand optimized low level matrix functions for both x68 and x64 platforms.
Beside the low level matrix functions there are also numerous high level ones like LU decomposition, singular value decomposition, matrix inversion, pseudo inversion and many more.
All functions are written in plain Delphi/assembler and do not need any third party components/dlls!
